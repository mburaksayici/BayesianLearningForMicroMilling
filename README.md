# BayesianLearningForMicroMilling

Honoured to work with Prof. YiÄŸit KARPAT of Bilkent University for 2 years. Works have been getting serious for 1 semester. Here's the simulation of the paper : https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00170-017-0567-8  using PyMC3 for Monte Carlo Markov Chain with sampling methodologies. Actual purpose of the new work is to predict the cutting coefficients in order to forecast the forces. Since this is the imitation of the published paper, there'll be no problem, however current works are not published at GitHub yet.
